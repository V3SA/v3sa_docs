# Intro

## What is DaPP?

DaPP is a payment processor. It allows you to pay someone **some amount of tokens** over **some amount of time** with _minimized risk_.

## Mission

DaPP enables a consistent stream of money in exchange for work done or other terms both parties must decide on. This payment contract should be cancellable to discourage being locked into contracts with no-workers or being paid with tokens that are slipping sharply in value.

## Strategies

1. Trial period

When paying someone you don't have a trust relationship with yet, you can initiate a short term dapp contract (1 week - 3 months) for some work to test their loyalty. After confirming they are performing in good faith, you can open up longer contracts with them to secure their long-term gigs.

2. Overlapping contracts with increasing payment amounts

You can start a low token amount / long term contract with a worker to get them interested in working for you and acquiring more contracts. On successful performance, you can grant them a higher token amount / shorter term contract every so often to reward them. You can have the long term contracts be utility/voting tokens or tokens representing company stock and the shorter term contracts be USDC or SOL.

3. Winnable contracts

You can have your DAO issue payment contracts to winners of certain hackathons or art events. This can diversify your workforce and encourage engagement on those advertisements.

## Examples

#### Web3 World

1. You are a NFT project founder. You want to hire devs to help you mint NFTs but you don't want them to leave with a lump sum of money right after mint and leave your project rugged. You pay them with DaPP over the course of 6 months. If they leave after 3 months, you can cancel the contract and recover the remainder of the funds.
2. You want to pay your NFT holders some amount of tokens to encourage them not to sell. You can have them stake their NFT with your smart contract, your smart contract can open a DaPP contract with the user which will be cancelled when the user unstakes their NFT.
3. You want to load a smart contract's Token Account with money over time as part of your contract's token security strategy. If your smart contract gets hacked, it won't lose all of your/your users' funds.
4. You want to pay an external DAO in your token to use some of their services. Your token enables voting rights in your DAO but you don't want them too have too much voting power initially so they can't drain funds or make malicious voting decisions.
5. You want to create NFT-less vesting periods for memberships. You require users to have an active DaPP contract with USDC/SOL/Some Utility Token open for at least 3 out of 12 months for some amount of tokens to be a basic member. At the end of their DaPP contract, you update their account state or issue them an NFT which makes their membership permanent. You can also use this to enable whitelists for your NFT project.
6. You want to slow-mint your token. You mint 10k tokens for this quarter. You load them into a dapp contract and slow load them into your DAO's Token Account.

#### TradFi World

1. You want to pay your employees some crypto as part of their benefits package. You offer them 100 SOL the first year they work with you. 100 SOL and 1000 USDC the second year they work with you. 200 SOL, 2000 USDC and 12 Company Stock tokens every year after that.
2. Be creative ;)
